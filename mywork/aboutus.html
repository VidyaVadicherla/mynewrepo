          <p class="second-section-para">The use of advanced technologies such as sensors, drones, and satellite imagery is expected to increase in farming. These tools can provide real-time data on soil moisture, nutrient levels, and crop health, enabling farmers to optimize their resource usage and improve overall productivity.<br>There is a growing emphasis on sustainable farming practices to minimize environmental impact. Techniques such as organic farming, agroforestry, and regenerative agriculture are gaining traction. These methods focus on soil health, biodiversity, and reducing chemical inputs.Vertical farming involves growing crops indoors in stacked layers, using artificial lighting and a controlled environment. This method can increase crop yields while reducing the need for land and water. It is expected to gain popularity, especially in urban areas with limited space for traditional agriculture.Climate change is expected to pose significant challenges to agriculture in the future. </p>

          <h1 class="second-section-content-heading">Organic Farming</h1>
          <p class="second-section-para">Organic farming is a method of agriculture that relies on the use of natural inputs and processes to produce food and other crops.<br>
             It is a sustainable approach to farming that seeks to minimize the use of synthetic chemicals and other harmful inputs that can damage the environment, soil, and crops.Organic farming practices typically include the use of natural fertilizers, such as compost and manure, to improve soil health and promote plant growth. <br>
             Organic farmers may also use natural pest control methods, such as crop rotation, companion planting, and the introduction of beneficial insects, rather than relying on synthetic pesticides.
             Organic farmers prioritize soil health by using practices such as crop rotation, cover cropping, and composting. These methods enhance soil fertility, structure, and water-holding capacity, while reducing erosion and nutrient leaching.

          <p class="second-section-para">Pesticides and fertilizers are essential components of modern agriculture. They play a significant role in improving crop yields and protecting plants from pests, diseases, and nutrient deficiencies.While pesticides are effective tools for pest management, their use has raised environmental and health concerns. Overuse or misuse of pesticides can lead to water and soil contamination, harm beneficial organisms like pollinators and natural predators, and pose risks to human health if not handled properly.Pesticides help to reduce crop losses caused by pests and diseases, increase agricultural productivity, and improve food quality by minimizing damage from insects or pathogens.Fertilizers typically contain three primary nutrients: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). These are often referred to as NPK fertilizers. Other secondary and micronutrients like calcium, magnesium, sulfur, and trace elements may also be included in fertilizer formulations.Fertilizers replenish nutrient levels in the soil, improving plant health, growth, and productivity. They help address nutrient deficiencies, enhance root development, and promote higher yields in crops.
